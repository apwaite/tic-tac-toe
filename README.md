A broswer version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game!

This project uses two different patterns:

1. The factory function pattern which is used as an alternative to constructors or classes to set up and return new objects.
2. The module pattern which utilises IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) for encapsulation. This allows for namespacing, a technique used that helps avoid naming collisions when creating new variables.
