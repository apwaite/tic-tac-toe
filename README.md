# Tic Tac Toe

## Short Description

A broswer version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game!

## Instructions

During play an on hover effect clearly indicates which section of the grid the player will place their mark. Players can tell whether it's their turn by looking for the underlined player or by reading the instructions above the gameboard. The instructions above the gameboard also displays the winner or whether there's a draw. When a draw or win occurs a game over overlay appears on top of the gameboard, announcing the winner and preventing any further marks from being placed. Players can reset the game by clicking a try again button that appears as part of the overlay during a draw or win, or they choose to start a new game at any time by clicking the new game button below the gameboard.

## Features

This project uses two different patterns:

1. The factory function pattern which is used as an alternative to constructors or classes to create and return new objects.
2. The module pattern which utilises IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) for encapsulation. This allows for namespacing, a technique used to helps avoid naming collisions when creating new variables.
