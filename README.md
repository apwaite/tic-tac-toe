# Tic Tac Toe

## Short Description

A broswer version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game!

## Features

This project uses two different patterns:

1. The factory function pattern which is used as an alternative to constructors or classes to create and return new objects.
2. The module pattern which utilises IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) for encapsulation. This allows for namespacing, a technique used to helps avoid naming collisions when creating new variables.
